Problem Scenario
You are developing a logistics management system for a delivery company. 
The company needs to find the most efficient delivery routes between multiple warehouses and delivery points. 
The warehouses and delivery points are represented as vertices in a directed graph, and the roads between them are represented as edges with weights corresponding to the travel time. 
Some roads might have negative weights due to factors such as toll rebates, express lanes, or subsidies. However, there are no negative cycles in the graph.
Your task 
is to implement a system that:Calculates the shortest travel times between all pairs of locations (warehouses and delivery points).
Finds the most time-efficient route for each delivery.SolutionWe'll use Johnson's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths between all pairs of locations.


Example of Input and OutputInput:A logistics graph with 5 locations and 8 roads, with some roads having negative weights.Locations: {"Warehouse A", "Warehouse B", "Delivery Point 1", "Delivery Point 2", "Delivery Point 3"}Roads (edges) with weights:Warehouse A -> Warehouse B : 3
Warehouse A -> Delivery Point 1 : 8
Warehouse A -> Delivery Point 3 : -4
Warehouse B -> Delivery Point 2 : 1
Warehouse B -> Delivery Point 3 : 7
Delivery Point 1 -> Warehouse B : 4
Delivery Point 2 -> Warehouse A : 2
Delivery Point 2 -> Delivery Point 1 : -5Output:Shortest travel times between every pair of locations:
Warehouse A to Warehouse A: 0 minutes
Warehouse A to Warehouse B: 1 minutes
Warehouse A to Delivery Point 1: -3 minutes
Warehouse A to Delivery Point 2: 2 minutes
Warehouse A to Delivery Point 3: -4 minutes

Warehouse B to Warehouse A: 3 minutes
Warehouse B to Warehouse B: 0 minutes
Warehouse B to Delivery Point 1: -4 minutes
Warehouse B to Delivery Point 2: 1 minutes
Warehouse B to Delivery Point 3: -1 minutes

Delivery Point 1 to Warehouse A: 7 minutes
Delivery Point 1 to Warehouse B: 4 minutes
Delivery Point 1 to Delivery Point 1: 0 minutes
Delivery Point 1 to Delivery Point 2: 5 minutes
Delivery Point 1 to Delivery Point 3: 3 minutes

Delivery Point 2 to Warehouse A: 2 minutes
Delivery Point 2 to Warehouse B: -1 minutes
Delivery Point 2 to Delivery Point 1: -5 minutes
Delivery Point 2 to Delivery Point 2: 0 minutes
Delivery Point 2 to Delivery Point 3: -6 minutes

Delivery Point 3 to Warehouse A: Infinity minutes
Delivery Point 3 to Warehouse B: Infinity minutes
Delivery Point 3 to Delivery Point 1: Infinity minutes
Delivery Point 3 to Delivery Point 2: Infinity minutes
Delivery Point 3 to Delivery Point 3: 0 minutes

Explanation of the Output
The output shows the shortest travel times between every pair of locations.
If the shortest travel time between two locations is "Infinity", it means there is no path connecting the two locations in the graph.
